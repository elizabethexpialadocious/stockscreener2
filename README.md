Just a simple stock screener. Couple of caveats:
1) stock data comes from financialmodelingprep.com - so you need a key, and
2) option data comes from TDAmeritrade (for which you need a key as well)

I don't really mantain this anymore. Let me know if you have any questions. Hope someone likes it :-)
